# Math Does Not Lie

This example dates back to the 1970s, and demonstrates the

This is a great program to run and show anyone who claims computers are precise, 
to break them free from their perfection dilemna.

The output on a Windows 10 computer is:

```
x = 10
x = 20.00004
x = 30.00008
x = 39.99996
x = 49.99981
x = 59.99966
x = 69.9995
x = 79.99935
x = 89.9992
x = 99.99905
```
